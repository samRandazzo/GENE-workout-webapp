YOU WORKOUT. WE DONATE
<br>
<br>
<br>
HOW IT WORKS
<br>
SET UP AN ACCOUNT 
<br>
DO THE WORKOUT PROVIDED 
<br> 
ONCE COMPLETED WE DONATE $$$ TO A VETERAN ORGANIZATION
<br>
This is the first fitness app that gives you the user real incentives to help those in need. We need to be 
more accountable for the way our veterans are being treated. All you need to do is pick an organization to donate
 to and spend one hour working out. Then, a specified amount 
 is donated in your name by one of our partners. We are going to end the homeless veteran epidemic. </p>
